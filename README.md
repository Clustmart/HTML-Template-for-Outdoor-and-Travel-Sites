## Motivation

The template is intended to demonstrate how you can integrate a HTML website with Outdooractive and Tripadvisor widgets. It can be inspiration for your own destination/travel/outdoor/hotel/accomodation website.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.


## Installation

Download or clone this repository and search for tag [EDIT] to customize your code.
Prerequisite: You will need an Outdooractive project and key to display the map on the map.html page. No need for this if you use just the widgets.
